# Malaria-Detection
In this project I've used image processing techniques along with Convolutional neural networks for the prediction of malaria and achieved an accuracy of 99.56% on the validation set and 94-96% on the testing set. The model was trained on a dataset picked from kaggle containing over 13,776 parasitized images and 13,776 uninfected images. The image processing steps involved the use of a green filter to get rid of the noise from the cell images. This was followed by the setting up of a threshold after iterating over all the images to distinguish the parasitic patterns from the erythrocytes in case of uninfected cells. The cells which had the eccentricity values of the spot patterns greater than the threshold value were classified as infected whereas the others were classified as uninfected.
